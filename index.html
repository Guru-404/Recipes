        <p>
            The first step towards health is <strong>understanding what to eat</strong>. Eating healthy does not have to be complicated. It's so simple & easy! All we have to do is stop eating man-made products and get back to what Mother Nature which designed us to eat - fruits, vegetables, greens, sprouts, nuts & seeds.
            We just need to be aware of the <strong>4 food principles</strong> <em>i.e. of eating living, wholesome, water-rich, plant-based food</em>. These food principles are timeless and universal, which means that they are applicable for anyone wanting to live a healthy, happy & disease-free life.

                The thoughts in our head, the activities we perform, the people we meet, the food we eat can all be classified as Satvic, Rajasik or Tamasik.
