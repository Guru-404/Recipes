        <strong>Note:</strong> This pumpkin soup ticks all the boxes! Its rich, creamy and ultimately satisfying. The rosemary & thyme combine to create a unique flavor, which you may have never experienced before.
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <h4>Soup Base</h4>
            <li>1⁄2 kg red pumpkin, with peel</li>
            <li>3 cups coconut milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh thyme or 2 teaspoons dry thyme</li>
            <li>1 stem fresh rosemary or 1⁄2 teaspoon dry rosemary</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon rock salt</li>
            <h4>Toppings</h4>
            <li>12 tablespoons pumpkin seeds</li>
            <li>1⁄2 red bell pepper, cut into strips</li>
            <li>1⁄4 small coconut, cut into strips</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Pre-preparation</h3>
        Prepare coconut milk.
        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop the pumpkin into chunks. Do not take the peel off. Add it to a steamer and let it steam for about 20 minutes, until soft.</li>
            <li>Once the pumpkin has cooled, place it in a blender, along with the coconut milk, thyme, rosemary, salt and chili. Blend until smooth.</li>
            <li>Pour the soup into bowls, add the toppings from above and serve.</li>
        </ol>
        <strong>Tip: </strong> Do not re-heat the soup because we should never cook coconut or coconut milk on the stove.<br>
        <strong>Tip: </strong> Make sure you add rosemary and thyme to this soup, since they carry all the flavor. In case fresh is not available, use their dried versions.
