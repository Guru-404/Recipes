            <p>
                Lord Krishna, in the Bhagavad Gita states that all embodied souls are working under the control of 3 modes, or qualities of material nature -<br>

                The thoughts in our head, the activities we perform, the people we meet, the food we eat can all be classified as Satvic, Rajasik or Tamasik.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>Each mode has different characteristics</h3>
                <img src="../images/different-modes.png" alt="different characteristics of each mode" style="width:550px;height:400px;">
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>One person can have multiple modes</h3>
                <img src="../images/modes-of-person.png" alt="modes of a person" style="width:550px;height:250px;"><br>
                Our modern lifestyle with its high levels of stress and toxins, leads to a life that fluctuates between Rajasik and Tamasik modes. To achieve happiness, we have to transcend from Tamasik and Rajasik to Satvic.

            <p>
                <h3>Our food can also be Satvik, Rajasik or Tamasik</h3>

                To follow the Satvic diet, we need Satvic recipes and hence we have created <a href="https://satvicmovement.org/products/the-satvic-food-book" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this book</a>. Satvic recipes are different from other so-called 'healthy recipes'. They follow strict Satvic food laws and are made especially for healing and achieving the maximum potential of this
                human body.
